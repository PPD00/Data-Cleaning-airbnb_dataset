## Data Cleaning Project - Airbnb Dataset

This project focuses on cleaning an Airbnb dataset containing multiple variables and numerous entries. The goal is to prepare the data for analysis.

## Project Overview

In this project, we cleaned the Airbnb dataset using SQL. Here are the steps we followed:

1. Connect to Database: We connected the dataset to SQL Server to manage and manipulate the data effectively.

2. Check Initial Data: We viewed the dataset to understand its structure and identify areas needing cleaning.
SELECT * FROM airbnb_data

3. Remove Null Values: We removed entries with missing information, especially from critical columns like price, last_review, five_stars and more.

4. Remove Duplicates: We identified and removed duplicate entries using SQL techniques to ensure data integrity.

5. Delete Unused Columns: We removed columns that were not necessary for our analysis, such as neighbourhood_full.

6. Final Review: Finally, we viewed the cleaned dataset to ensure that all cleaning steps were effective.
